  <h2>Hosting a Jam Site</h2>
  <p>We had over 30 locations worldwide last year, but we'd love to add more! It can take a lot of time and resources to host your own jam site, as you'll need to provide:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>workspace</li>
    <li>wireless internet access</li>
    <li>livestream camera</li>
    <li>projector or large televsion</li>
    <li>parking or nearby public transit access</li>
    <li>nearby access to restaurants</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Although not a requirement, some locations secure sponsors that provide:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>snacks and drinks</li>
    <li>t-shirts</li>
    <li>large meeting spaces</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Popular locations to host a jam include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>co-working spaces</li>
    <li>game studios</li>
    <li>colleges and universities</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Get in touch and let us know <b>how many people</b> you can accommodate at your site, the physical location, and any other information you think we should know about, and thanks for helping us save the games industry!</p>
